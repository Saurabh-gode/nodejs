## üß† Quick Byte Conversions

- **1 byte** = 8 bits  
- **1 Hex character** = 4 bits  
- **1 UTF-8 ASCII character** = 8 bits  

---

## üîÅ Encoding Conversions

### UTF-8 to Binary
```js
Buffer.from("some text", "utf-8");

Buffer.from("2347babab", "hex");

yourBuffer.toString("hex");

yourBuffer.toString("utf-8");

HEX | Binary
0 | 0000
1 | 0001
2 | 0010
3 | 0011
4 | 0100
5 | 0101
6 | 0110
7 | 0111
8 | 1000
9 | 1001
a | 1010
b | 1011
c | 1100
d | 1101
e | 1110
f | 1111

Example:
4D 4B 6A ‚Üí 0100 1101 0100 1011 0110 1010

======================================
============== GENERAL ===============
======================================
Key Terms
Random: Appears random to humans (e.g., Math.random(), SHA-256), but deterministic. Not cryptographically secure.

Cryptographically Secure Random: Generated by CSPRNGs like crypto.randomBytes(). Required for keys, IVs, and salts.

Integrity: Ensures data wasn't modified in transit.

Authentication: Confirms identity of the entity.

Confidentiality: Ensures only authorized parties can read data.

Cleartext: Unprotected data (could even be ciphertext if transmitted in plain view).

Plaintext: Original, unencrypted data.

Ciphertext: Encrypted data.

Encryption/Decryption: Transforming plaintext ‚Üî ciphertext.

Cipher: Algorithm used for encryption/decryption.

Cryptanalyst: Tries to break cryptographic systems.

XOR: Bitwise operation used in cryptography.

Entropy: Measure of randomness; high entropy = strong security.

Padding: Adds data to match block size.

NIST: U.S. standards body for cryptography (AES, SHA).

FIPS: Government cryptographic standards (e.g., enable with crypto.setFips(1)).

NSA: Research agency that developed SHA.

Quantum Computing: Uses qubits; powers algorithms like Shor‚Äôs and Grover‚Äôs.

Brute-Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations.

Kerckhoffs's Principle: Security should depend only on key secrecy.

NONCE: "Number used once", often part of AES-GCM IV.

======================================
======= SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION =========
======================================
Algorithms & Concepts
Caesar Cipher: Shifts letters by a fixed amount (e.g., "HELLO" ‚Üí "KHOOR").

OTP (One-time Pad): Perfect, unbreakable encryption.

AES: Industry-standard symmetric cipher. Block size: 128 bits. Key sizes: 128, 192, 256 bits.

AES Modes

Mode | Notes
ECB | Insecure
CBC | IV = 16 bytes
CTR | IV = 16 bytes
GCM | IV = 12 bytes recommended; includes MAC
XTS | Used for disk encryption

IV (Initialization Vector): Adds randomness, must be secure.

MAC (Message Authentication Code): Verifies integrity and authenticity.

ChaCha20: AES alternative, fast in software.


======================================
============== HASHING ===============
======================================
Definitions
Message: Input to hash function.

Digest: Output of hash function.

Hash Algorithms

Name | Notes
MD5 | Broken, avoid
SHA1 | Weak
SHA2 | SHA-224/256/384/512
SHA3 | SHA3-224/256/384/512
Blake2 | Fast and strong


Properties
Preimage Resistance: Can‚Äôt derive input from hash.

Second Preimage Resistance: Can‚Äôt find a different message with same hash.

Collision Resistance: Can‚Äôt find two inputs with same hash.

Avalanche Effect: Small input change ‚Üí big output change.

Rainbow Tables: Precomputed hashes; defeated by salting.

Pigeonhole Principle: Infinite collisions are inevitable.

Birthday Paradox: Collisions are more likely than expected.

Length Extension Attack: Appending data to a hashed message (vulnerable functions only).

======================================
================ MAC =================
======================================
HMAC: Combines hash with secret key.

GHASH: Used in AES-GCM for authentication.

AAD: Data authenticated but not encrypted (e.g., headers).

Poly1305: Used with ChaCha20 for MAC.

======================================
== KEY DERIVATION FUNCTIONS (KDFs) ===
======================================
Salt: Prevents rainbow table attacks.

PBKDF2: Slows brute-force via iterations.

Scrypt: Memory-hard, protects against large-scale cracking.

HKDF: Uses HMAC in extract-expand stages.

Argon2: Modern, secure KDF and 2015 Password Hashing Competition winner.
